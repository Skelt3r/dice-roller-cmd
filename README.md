Run the main.py file to get started.

Here's a breakdown of the syntax:
- `> roll {number_of_dice}d{type_of_dice}{arithmetic_operator}{modifier}`

...and some examples:
- `> roll 1d6 -> Result: 2`
- `> roll 1d20+5 -> Result: 14 + 5 | Sum: 19`
- `> roll 2d6-1 -> Results: [5, 2] + 1 | Sum: 8`
- `> roll 8d4+10 -> Results: [4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1] + 10 | Sum: 31`

The program can also roll a randomly generated set of ability scores for everyone's favorite tabletop RPG.

Just use the `stats`command:
- `> stats -> [17, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]`
