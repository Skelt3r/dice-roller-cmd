Run the main.py file to get started.

Here's a breakdown of the syntax:
- `> roll {number_of_dice}d{type_of_dice}{arithmetic_operator}{arithmetic_value}`

...and some examples:
- `> roll 1d6`
- `> roll 1d20+5`
- `> roll 2d6-1`
- `> roll 8d4+10`

The program can also roll a randomly generated set of ability scores for everyone's favorite tabletop RPG.

Just use the `stats`command:
- `> stats -> [17, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]`
